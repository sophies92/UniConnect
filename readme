uniconnect

DESCRIPTION:
    A wrapper for sshfs, for locally mounting filesystems available remotely on the Aber Uni network.
        *If trying to mount a filesystem from a non-Aber Uni netowrk you must be using the
        GlobalProtect VPN.

INSTALLATION:
    1 - Copy the file "uniconnect" to "$HOME/.local/bin".
    2 - Add the line "export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" " to "$HOME/.bashrc" if it is not present.
        * Log-out and log-in may be required.

USAGE:
    Mounting a filesystem:
        In a terminal, enter "uniconnect", followed by the filesystem name to be mounted [targetDrive],
        followed by your Aber Uni username/log-in name [username].

    Unmounting a filesystem:
        In a terminal, enter "uniconnect", followed by "-u", followed by the name of the filesystem to be
        unmounted [targetDrive].
            * If "-u" is replaced by "-v", the local mount directories will not be removed after unmounting
            the filesystem.

    Cleaning local mount directories:
        If the local mount directories were not removed while unmounting a file system, it can be removed 
        by opening a terminal, and entering "uniconnect", followed by "-c", followed by the filesystem 
        directory to be removed [targetDrive].

    Help:
        In a terminal, entering "uniconnect", followed by "-h", will show the help text.
